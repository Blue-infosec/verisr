3.0.9008
* fixed columns filtering issues
* getenumDeep still needs fixing.

3.0.9007.1
* added 'columns' back in to flatten, but does not seem to be applied.
* crashes on running flatten seem to be environmental rather than code

3.0.9007
* flatten() mostly working.  Not tested with getenumDeep.  Still seems to crash for unknown reasons.
* recurse_columns is no longer used.
* 'columns' removed from flatten.  In theory I think it could be applied to the first item in the df.unjoined list.  Currently filtering happens after joining and so while the column may be included in it's deepest dataframe, during subsequent joins and iterations it will be removed which is counterproductive.
* Added 'sequence' boolean value to flatten() to indicate whether you want to flatten sequence or separate it out by step.  getenumDeep() will need to use this when by="sequence".  (When enum=sequence, 'sequence.length' can be used.)


3.0.9006
* starting on necessities for getenumCI to work on hierarchical verisr objects, specifically recurse_columns

3.0.9005
* getPatterns() and post.proc() now working
* consequently json2veris is now working
* flatten() should also be working
* no getenum() for sequenced dataframes exists yet.

3.0.9004.1
* finished getPatterns() and post.proc()
* still needs testing

3.0.9003
* flatten() mostly working
* fixed two issues in json2veris

3.0.9002
* working to fix issue with empty properties objects in schema not showing up in data (i.e. the discovery_method.unknown problem)
* added discovery_method convenience columns.

3.0.9001
* Updated json2veris to read VERIS v2.0 json
* Not yet tested
* Significant performance issues expected
